8 . terraform plan -var-file=terraform.tfvars
9. terraform apply -auto-approve

# infrastructure is raised

10 . terraform destroy -auto-approve


Things to do later : 
1 . Reduce the permissions of the tf user from the IAM. Elevated access for Initial Deployements.
2 . Add backend for Terraform 
3 . Modularize the Tf files (As a developement Created raw tf files)
4 . Do the backend as s3 (Currently local tfstate storage) for the deployemnt to any account
    Need to rerun terraform init after setting backend.
